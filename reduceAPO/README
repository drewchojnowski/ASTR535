This program does basic image reduction (bias and overscan correction, flat-fielding) of data from APO 3.5m instruments DIS and ARCTIC.

It's pretty flexible - just start ipython, import it, and run it without setting any parameters, e.g.
In [1]: import apored as a
In [2]: x=a.test()
You will be prompted for needed info.

Important notes:

1. for ARCTIC, UT160327, the file "160327.0047.fits" seems to be corrupted, and "ARCTIC_Bias.0001.fits" has a weird trend that doesn't show up in subsequent biases. Move these files to a "bad" directory before running the script.

2. for DIS, UT160328, make another "bad" directory and move the following files into it: 160328.0038*.fits, Ar.0003*.fits, He.0001*.fits, Ne.0002*.fits

3. for DIS, UT160328, we neglected to get biases for the B400/R300 grating observations.
