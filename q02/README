(1) Look at observing schedule and some observing night logs. What are the NMSU programs this quarter?

NM01. Pre-Juno Characterization of Jupiter's Atmosphere with Hyperspectral Imaging (Nancy Chanover)
NM02. NMSU ASTR535 : graduate student training (Jon Holtzman)
NM03. Mutual Events of (79360) 1997 CS29 Sila-Nunam (Nancy Chanover)
NM04. Halpha Imaging of Edge-on Galaxies in CHANG-ES Sample (Carlos Vargas)
NM05. Spectroscopy of Superthin Galaxies (Dmitry Bizyaev)
NM06. NIR photometry of edge-on galaxies: MaNGA and = superthins (Dmitry Bizyaev)
NM07. Calibrate LEGUE Pipeline Stellar Parameter with High Resolution Spectra (Kaike Pan)
NM08. Peculiar variable stars in UMi dSph Galaxy (Karen Kinemuchi)

(2) Check out the 10 micron all-sky camera images at night. What are the images and graphs showing, and what do they tell you?

The image shows the sky, so that one can monitor clouds, and the graphs indicate sky brightness and variability of sky brightness as a function of time.

(3) Look through the Instruments pages, and at anything else which might interest you. If anything stimulates a question, write it down. 

Regarding ARCTIC... what are the chances of getting a tunable [O III] 5007 filter?

(4) Submit housing request for 3/25-3/27 (3 nights) 

Done.
