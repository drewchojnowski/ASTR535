4/27/16 Update:

Executive decisions by Drew:
1. Users are required to supply a *V-band* magnitude
2. For moon phase, users are required to supply a value between 0 and 14, indicating the numbers of days since new moon.

Things that currently work:
- optional user input
- establishment of some instrument paramaters, depending on instrument choice
- blackbody calculator
- interpolator
- mirror throughput calculation

Things that currently don't work:
- everything else
