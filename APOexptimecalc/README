4/27/16 Update:

I propose that we require users to input a V-band magnitude

Things that currently work:
- optional user input
- establishment of some instrument paramaters, depending on instrument choice
- blackbody calculator
- interpolator
- mirror throughput calculation

Things that currently don't work:
- everything else
